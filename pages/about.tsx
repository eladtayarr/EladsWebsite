                During my third year, I participated in the honors program for high-achieving students, which exposed me to academic research and international collaboration. Our research, in partnership with HHN University in Germany, focused on the impact of uncertainty, variation, and diversity in large organizations, using XMCyber as a case study. I was responsible for designing the questionnaire, organizing interview data, and presenting our findings. Our work received a score of 90 and excellent feedback from the program's professors.

                As a Shift Manager at Hugo Boss, I was instrumental in driving the store's success by consistently meeting and exceeding sales targets, earning the highest performance statistics in the network. My strong leadership skills led to a promotion to Shift Manager after just a year and a half, where I took on greater responsibilities in managing store operations and leading a dynamic team.
                <br></br><br></br>
                In this role, I was responsible for overseeing daily operations, coordinating and managing the shift team, and ensuring that inventory levels were adequately maintained through precise orders. I also handled financial management tasks, ensuring accurate cash handling and sales reconciliation, and maintained continuous communication with senior management to align store activities with company goals.
                <br></br><br></br>
                A key aspect of my role involved working closely with both senior management and store staff, particularly during inventory counts and store organization efforts. My ability to foster teamwork and ensure smooth operational processes contributed significantly to the store's overall performance and customer satisfaction.

                During my military service in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), I served as an Information Systems Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO) within the Human Resources Branch. 
                Initially responsible for welfare tasks, such as managing housing for lone soldiers and administering special allowances, I was later promoted to the office of the Head of the Personnel Directorate to focus on information systems management.
                <br></br><br></br>
                In this role, I was responsible for generating transactions with ABAP queries, creating and organization reports, and conducting data analysis. 
                I worked extensively with SAP ERP and the Discoverer Viewer Oracle system to automate report generation and manage data effectively. 
                My role required significant interaction with senior military personnel, contributing to various high-impact projects, including the Increasing rent for single soldiers by 23%, and issuing holiday vouchers for single soldiers and soldiers with financial difficulties. 
                The work was carried out in front of senior military officials and officials in the field.
                <br></br><br></br>
                This experience honed my technical skills in data management, report generation, and system maintenance, while also enhancing my ability to work under pressure and maintain strict confidentiality with sensitive information.
